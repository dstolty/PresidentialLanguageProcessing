> Model: 5:38:27The President:Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Please, everybody, be seated. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. It is wonderful to see all of you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please, please have a seat. Thank you.Thank you, everybody, for the wonderful introduction. Thank you for the warm welcome. Please give David a big round of applause. I want to thank all of you for taking the time to be here today. I want to thank our host, the Chamber of Commerce, for bringing together so many leaders from business, from labor, from all across the political spectrum, to talk about how we move this country forward.It is a great pleasure to be here, especially because I am in the company of some very impressive people. We've got somebody who I think is going to be one of the greatest Speakers of all time in Nancy Pelosi. She is terrific. And she has been a great friend of mine for a very long time. I also want to acknowledge a great friend of mine and a great Senator from the great State of New York, Chuck Schumer, who is here.I'm here because there are a lot of things that I have to do as President. I've got to work on health care. I've got to work on energy and the environment. I've got to work on education. I've got to work on our national security. But there's nothing more important than the economy and jobs, because everything else flows from that. And that's why I'm here today, because even as we work to secure a recovery that's still fragile and we're still climbing out of a hole that's been dug over the last decade, the single most important thing that we can do is to get this economy moving and to get businesses hiring and to get people back to work.This is a challenge that is not unique to this country. Across the globe, as businesses and economies have been struggling to recover, the one thing that everybody is worried about is that this recovery is not strong enough. They're worried that the recovery is not sustained. They're worried that it's not broad enough.

> Model: 23d Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment, August 1863. (Broadside printed in Philadelphia, Pa., by C.C. Peterson, 1863).The President of the United States, in his response to the address of the Chief-Justice of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the people of that State, said:GENTLEMEN: In a speech like that to which you have listened, no man can add a single word. I am not bound to speak, but I am not at liberty to refrain. The thoughts which I shall now express are the result of a full deliberation, and are, with me, solemnly determined.I have been asked to deliver what is called a "few words" upon this occasion. I have been asked to speak briefly. I can not do so. I am not in the habit of making such requests to others; and, having determined not to do so to myself, and to say what I shall say, I can not say less than I shall say.I know that to you, as to myself, the nation is all in all. I know that to you, as to myself, we dedicated this struggle for a cause which will live in history and in the world, so long as the memory of man shall endure. I know that to you, as to myself, the great task remaining to be performed by those who began it, is to carry on through the dark passage of time, until the nation shall again stand erect, and take its place among the nations of the earth. We have a good cause; we have a right on our side; we have the moral, the physical, and the material power with us. All that we want is to bring our task to a successful conclusion. It is all we ask. It is all we shall get.The people of the United States have never failed, in any great trial, to vindicate their national honor and their national interests.I know that you, as well as myself, prize the national honor above all else. I know that you, as well as myself, are in earnest in this great cause. I know that you, as well as myself, believe that the great task remaining to be performed by those who began it, is to carry on through the dark passage of time until the nation shall again stand erect and take its place among the nations of the earth. Therefore, I am not in haste; I am not anxious


> User: Write a speech like George Washington from 1789. Make it about the future of the nation.

> Model: 29 June 1789To the officers and soldiers of the 1st American Regiment:Gentlemen:I receive with much pleasure the testimony which you are so good as to give of your approbation of my conduct. I accept it with the sentiments of an humble and grateful citizen, who is conscious of having discharged a duty which he could not but regard as arduous. I can not help expressing my regret, however, that my first official act should be to declare the necessity of calling a Congress of the United States; and that I should be obliged to recommend such a measure for the investigation of the grounds of the public discontent and the devise of such further measures as may be judged indispensable.It is the duty of the President of the United States to recommend such measures as he may deem indispensable to the common safety. He can not, however, proceed in his duties without the co-operation of the legislature. The most important of these is the establishment of a revenue. The power of collecting revenue from the people by internal taxes is essential to the existence of governments. The power to regulate commerce is equally indispensable. The defect of the present Confederation in this particular is in a great measure the cause of the present unhappy differences.It is my sincere desire to establish harmony and union on a solid and permanent foundation. This is the great object of my public care. I can not, however, disguise from myself that our public affairs are in a situation requiring the most vigorous exertions and patient perseverance.I hope that a spirit of conciliation and union will be cultivated by the representatives of the United States in Congress and that the several States will be induced to meet the wants of the Union by a fair and liberal contribution. I can not but suppose that the people of America will expect that the Congress will devise such further provisions as appear to them necessary for the public safety.I shall, therefore, take it for granted that all your constituents will be disposed to co-operate with the Congress in the measures which it may adopt, and that they will be convinced that their own interest as well as the interest of the Union require them to do so.It is due to you to say that you have performed your part of the work of defence with so much zeal and military skill that I can not

🇺🇸 Gettysburg Address
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as the final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.

It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
