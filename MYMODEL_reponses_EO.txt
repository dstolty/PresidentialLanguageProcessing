There is hereby created a committee to be known as the War Production Board which shall be composed of a chairman, and five other members, to be designated by the President, all of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the President. The chairman and four other members of the War Production Board shall be appointed from outside the executive branch of the Government. The chairman of the War Production Board shall be appointed by the President from among the members of the Board.
The War Production Board shall have the following functions and duties:
1. To provide for the most effective prosecution of the war program for the production, procurement, and distribution of materials, commodities, articles, and services for war; to coordinate the war production program of the Government; to ensure the most effective mobilization of the industrial and scientific resources of the country for war purposes; and to eliminate, to the extent authorized by law, waste and bureaucratic delay in war production.
2. To issue such directives and regulations as may be necessary or desirable to accomplish its functions and duties under this order, and to exercise any powers heretofore or hereafter conferred on the President by law pertaining to war production, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power to direct, manage, and regulate the production of materials, commodities, articles, and services for war.

This has sometimes meant curtailing the production of non-essential consumer goods, and sometimes even limiting the production of essential goods.
The War Production Board has also been responsible for the issuance of directives and regulations related to the war economy. These directives and regulations have been issued to ensure that the war economy is operating as efficiently as possible. In addition, the Board has been responsible for investigating complaints about war production directives and regulations.
The War Production Board has also been responsible for reporting on the progress of the war economy and making recommendations to the President about the need for further legislation or other action to ensure the most effective prosecution of the war economy.

> Model: 1. The object of this order is to remedy the evil complained of in the message to Congress of the 4th of December last, by restoring to the chief executive more control over the general and department commanders, and to the Congress more authority over the Executive.2. By the first article of the Constitution, the President "shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the United States." The power is general, and either to be executed or neglected at the pleasure of the President. It includes the whole of the executive authority. It comprehends all the laws and all the officers of the United States and of the several States within the field of its operation.3. By the 14th section of the act of 3d March, 1803, the President has been authorized to call forth the militia to "repel sudden attack" and to suppress insurrections. But the power is qualified by the proviso that the President shall, "on all occasions, call on the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasion." In other words, whenever the laws of the Union are to be executed, whenever insurrections are to be suppressed, and invasions repelled, the President is authorized to call forth the militia.4. In the message of the 4th of December last, the President stated that the power of calling forth the militia had been so construed as to relieve the President from the obligation to call it forth whenever the laws of the United States were to be executed, insurrections were to be suppressed, and invasions repelled, and that he was authorized to call it forth only when the laws of the United States were not to be executed, insurrections were not to be suppressed, and invasions were not to be repelled.5. By the third article of amendment to the Constitution, the President is authorized to "call forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasion."6. In the message of the 4th of December last, the President states that the President is not authorized to call forth the militia to "execute the laws of the United States," and that, while the militia are authorized to be
